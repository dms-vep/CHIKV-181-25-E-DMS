The line plot shows the difference in effects of mutations at each site between a <em>comparator</em> and <em>reference</em> cell line (use the dropdowns below the plot to choose which cell line is the <em>comparator</em> and <em>reference</em>). If you click on sites on that line plot, then the heatmaps below the line plot will zoom to show that cite in the center, and you can mouseover the the heatmaps to see the effect of the mutation in each cell. The scatter plot to the right of the heatmaps shows the effect of each mutation in each of the two cells being compared. In the heatmap, gray indicates a mutation that was not measured and <code>x</code> indicates the amino acid in the parental 181/25 strain. You can zoom in using the zoom bar below the line plot. The options below the chart also allow you to show difference metrics for how the difference between mutation effects is calculated for the line plot, as well as the floor assigned to the mutation effects in the plots.</p><p>(Click <a href="htmls/compare_cell_entry_site_zoom.html" target="_self">here</a> for a standalone version of the plot.)</p>',6)),a(n,{caption:"Zoomable plot of differences in mutation effects on entry across cells"},{default:l(()=>[a(s,{showShadow:!0,"spec-url":"htmls/compare_cell_entry_site_zoom.html"})]),_:1}),e[1]||(e[1]=t("h2",{id:"scatter-plot-of-mutation-effects-in-different-cells",tabindex:"-1"},[o("Scatter plot of mutation effects in different cells "),t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#scatter-plot-of-mutation-effects-in-different-cells","aria-label":'Permalink to "Scatter plot of mutation effects in different cells"'},"​")],-1)),e[2]||(e[2]=t("p",null,"The scatter plots below show the effects of each mutation in each pair of cells.

Note that these measurements may be a bit more noisy than the cell entry measurements, and that the measurements for human Mxra8 and especially noisy and may be less reliable than those for mouse Mxra8 (see the analysis notebooks for <a href="notebooks/avg_escape_receptor_affinity_mouse_Mxra8.html" target="_self">mouse</a> and <a href="notebooks/avg_escape_receptor_affinity_human_Mxra8.html" target="_self">human</a> Mxra8 binding, respectively, to see the greater noise for the human Mxra8 binding).

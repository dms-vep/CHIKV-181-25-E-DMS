The <code>x</code> in each column indicates the amino-acid identity in the parental 181/25 CHIKV strain. Light gray squares indicate the effect of mutation was not reliably measured in our experiments. You can use the zoom bar at top to zoom into specific regions, and you can mouseover points for details about specific mutations. The lineplot at top shows the mean effect of mutations at each site.

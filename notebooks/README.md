# Analysis Notebooks

This directory contains custom analysis notebooks that will may be added to the pipeline at a later date.

## Notebooks

- [`compare-cell-entry`](/notebooks/compare-cell-entry.ipynb): Explores the differences between functional selections (cell entry) in three different cell lines; one expressing the known receptor **Mxra8**, one expressing the entry factor **TIM-1**, and **C636** mosquito cells expression an unknown receptor.

- [`plot-data-on-structures`](/notebooks/plot-data-on-structures.ipynb): Display the functional selections and difference between cell types on the CHIKV E + Mxra8 crystal structure with `dms-viz`.

## `dms-viz` visualizations

- [Functional selections on CHIKV E timer]()
- [Functional differences on CHIKV E monomer]()
- [Functional differences on CHIKV E trimer]()

A phylogenetic tree of CHIKV structural polyprotein (Capisd, E3, E2, 6K, E1) sequences download from NCBI virus on **April 4th, 2025**.

### Library Strain

Amino acid mutations are relative the 181/25 strain ([MW473668.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MW473668.1)) used to make an associated [deep mutational scanning library of the CHIKV E glycoprotein](https://github.com/dms-vep/CHIKV_181-25_E_DMS). Enter `181-25_MW473668` into the search bar to select the corresponding node on the tree.

### Lineage Information

The lineage of each viral sequence was determined using information from [the core Chikungunya virus Nextstrain build](https://nextstrain.org/groups/ViennaRNA/CHIKVnext) from the [Wolfinger lab](https://michaelwolfinger.com/). Sequences in both trees were labeled with the lineage name (called 'sublineage' in this tree). The lineage of sequences only present in this tree was inferred with `augur traits`. The nine lineages (sublineages) were grouped into four main lineages.

#### Lineage Names:

- African/Asian Lineages: `Asian Lineage`
- Sister Taxa to ECSA: `Asian Lineage`
- AUL-Am - Asian Urban + American Lineage: `Asian Lineage`
- AUL - Asian Urban Lineage: `Asian Lineage`
- EAL - Eastern African Lineage: `Indian Ocean`
- IOL - Indian Ocean Lineage: `Indian Ocean`
- MAL - Middle African Lineage: `East, Central, and South African (ECSA)`
- SAL - South American Lineage: `East, Central, and South African (ECSA)`
- WA - Western African Lineage: `West African Lineage`

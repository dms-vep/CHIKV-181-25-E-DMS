# Interactive phylogenetic tree with deep mutational scanning phenotypes
This interactive [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/) tree is built on the genes encoding the CHIKV structural genes.
You can use the *Color By* option on the left to color by the predicted phenotype of each sequence based on an additive model of the deep mutational scanning effects of all mutations relative to the CHIKV 181/25 strain.
Enter `181-25_MW473668` in the *Filter Data* box at left to show the 181/25 strain on the tree.

Go to [https://nextstrain.org/community/dms-vep/CHIKV-181-25-E-DMS@main](https://nextstrain.org/community/dms-vep/CHIKV-181-25-E-DMS@main) to view the tree on a new page, or use the embedded view below:

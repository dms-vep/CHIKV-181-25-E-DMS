# Analysis of E mutations in CHIKV passaging in mosquito cells
[Ali et al (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34561-x) report extensive passaging of the LR2006 strain of CHIKV in various mosquito cells.

[mosquito_passaging_mutations.csv](mosquito_passaging_mutations.csv): This file has the mutations that affect E from Supplemental Table 4 of [Ali et al (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34561-x) converted into the numbering scheme used in our deep mutational scanning. These are mutations that arose after extended passaging in mosquito cells.

# Mutations in CHIKV after Passaging

There are a handful of experiments where CHIKV has been passaged in difference cell types. I've collected some of that data here to see if there are mutations in at the receptor binding sites in the CHIKV E glycoprotein.

## Papers

- [This paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34561-x) passages a Vero-adapted [strain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore) in various mosquito cell types. I collected all of the mutations from the paper and converted the amino acid numbering to match our DMS data. That table is [here](passaging_mutations.csv).
